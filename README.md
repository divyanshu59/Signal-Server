# Signal-Server Full Installation Guide

- Written for Signal-Server v9.81.0
- Documented with a Debian-based server implementation in mind, though nothing besides the dependancies notes should be Debian-specific

### post-surgery
- [post-surgery `quickstart.sh`](surgerystart.sh)
- [post-surgery `config-surgery.yml`](config-surgery.yml)
- [post-surgery `config-secrets-bundle.yml`](config-secrets-bundle-surgery.yml)
- [post-surgery `docker-compose.yml](docker-compose-surgery.yml)

## Dependancies

- Java (openjdk)
- Maven (v3.8.6 or newer)
  - If on Debian, you may need to [manually install a newer version](dependancies.md)
- Docker and Docker-Compose

## Compilation

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/JJTofflemire/Signal-Server.git
```

- If you want to pull from signalapp's repo, you can run `git clone https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Server`, and if you want to specify v9.81.0, also run `git checkout 9c93d37`

Compile with:

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Pexclude-spam-filter
```

For quick recloning, [here](server-recloner.sh) is a script that moves personal `config.yml`, `config-secrets-bundle.yml`, and `secrets.sh` files out of `Signal-Server` before recloning and rebuilding with `source server-recloner.sh`

- Make sure you move `sever-recloner.sh` one directory up from `Signal-Server`

## Configuration

### Fill out `sample.yml` and `sample-secrets-bundle.yml`, located in `service/config/`

- Any configuration notes related to these two `.yml` files are located [here](config-documentation.md)

### Removing zkgroup dependancies

- In [`WhisperServerService.java`](service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/textsecuregcm/WhisperServerService.java), comment out lines 639, 739-40, 773-777

- Then run the following (make sure to back up all personal config bits)

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pexclude-spam-filter

mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pexclude-spam-filter
```

- In `Post-Surgery`, this has already been done

- This surgery is done to remove the `genericZkConfig.serverSecret` dependancy (and probably `zkConfig.serverSecret`) because Signal-Server requires `genericZkConfig` and provides no documentation on it or a way to generate it. It is definitely solvable but not within the timeframe that I have

## Starting the server

Run all dependancies wrapped in Docker containers with

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

Start the server with:

``` 
java -jar -Dsecrets.bundle.filename=service/config/sample-secrets-bundle.yml service/target/TextSecureServer-9.81.0.jar server service/config/sample.yml
```

## Starting the sever with [quickstart.sh](quickstart.sh)

- `quickstart.sh` is a bash script used to starting Signal-Server and all dependancies required with `source quickstart.sh`

- Currently the script should correctly identify the correct `server.jar` to start regardless of version or which repository is used

  - If `quickstart.sh` can't run the correct server, there is a bare-bones version commented out at the bottom of the script

- By default, `quickstart.sh` looks for `sample.yml` and `sample-secrets-bundle.yml` in the working directory, renamed to `config.yml` and `config-secrets-bundle.yml` to keep personal config files seperated from the sample files

- Currently, `quickstart.sh` exports any environmental variables needed by the server so that they don't have to live permanently in `.bashrc`

  - If you want to do the same thing, make a `secrets.sh` file with the AWS environmental variables from [config-documentation.md](config-documentation.md#aws-iam-configuration) - [here](sample-secrets.sh) is a `sample-secrets.sh`

- `quickstart.sh` also automatically stops all dependancies when it recieves a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) or when the server crashes

### [surgerystart.sh](surgerystart.sh) in `post-surgery`

- Inside the branch `post-surgery`, a seperate bash script is used to seperate config and startup with or without `zkconfig`

- It works the same way as `quickstart.sh`, but it refers to `docker-compose-surgery.yml`, `config-surgery.yml`, and `config-secrets-bundle-surgery.yml`

## Connecting the server to an Android app (unfinished)

- Current documentation on getting the Android app running and connected to this server is [here](https://github.com/JJTofflemire/Signal-Android)

## To-Do

### Configuring the server:

- Figure out what configuration [appConfig](config-documentation.md#aws-appconfig) wants in its .json file

- Add firebase documentation to Signal-Android and change the folder structure in Signal-Android

- Get `redis-cluster` recognizable and usable by Signal-Server

### Running the server:

- Be able to ping the server on `localhost`:

  - [Madeindra's](https://github.com/madeindra/signal-setup-guide/tree/master/signal-android) has instructions on this

  - NOTE: the server expects the [`X-Forwarded-for` header](https://github.com/madeindra/signal-setup-guide/tree/master/signal-server-4.xx#proxy)

- Convert all localhost configs to a real server (using NGINX) that a client could connect to following [this guide](https://github.com/madeindra/signal-setup-guide/tree/master/signal-server-2.92)

- Confirm that AWS / Google Cloud function as intended

- Check out a [local DynamoDB Docker instance](https://github.com/madeindra/signal-setup-guide/blob/master/signal-server-5.xx/docker-compose.yml)
